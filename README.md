# Job Processor Simulator
The program simulates a computer with multiple processors by using a priority queue. The goal is to determine how many processors should be used to process jobs most efficiently.

This was originally a school project done in C++ with a class partner. I decided to make a website for it.

The website is still under development, I'd like to continue adding features.
