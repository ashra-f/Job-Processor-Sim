# Job Processor Simulator
> The site is still under development, Looking to improve the overall structure and refactor the code.
The program simulates a computer with multiple processors by using a priority queue. The goal is to determine how many processors should be used to process jobs most efficiently.

This was originally a school project done in C++ with a class partner. I decided to make a website for it.
